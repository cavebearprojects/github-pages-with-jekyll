# What a Year!
This is the start of my new blog and I am trying to learn everything I need to make it everything that I want it to be. Thats right it is written for me and not for an as yet unknown and untapped audience.
And with that I say welcome to the blog and I will leave this blog with a quote from one of my favourite authors. 

>People who used magic without knowing what they were doing usually came to a sticky end.
>All over the entire room, sometimes. - **Terry Pratchett** *Moving Pictures*
